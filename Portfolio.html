                    <p><h4>Description:</h4> <br>The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with Xs and Os. The objective is to place three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row to win the game. This project is a straightforward implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing essential web development skills and interactive design. <br><br>

                        <h4>Key Features:</h4> <br>

                        Win Detection: Automatically checks for a winning combination after every move and displays the winner.
                        Draw Detection: Identifies when the game ends in a draw (when all cells are filled with no winner).
                        Game Status Display: Provides real-time updates on whose turn it is and announces the result of the game.
                        Game Reset: Includes a reset button to start a new game without reloading the page. <br><br>
